# DBXV2 Save Editor for Nintendo Switch

## Description

Just a simple save editor for the Nintendo Switch version of DBXV2. This is only meant to be a proof of concept, I will not be providing much support for this save editor.

## Requirements

- Your DBXV2 `savefile1.dat` file. Decrypting it will not be needed as an encryptor/decryptor is implemented in the save editor.
- .NET Framework ver 4.6 or above

## Features
- Money and TP Medal editor
- Unlock All Skills ( even some duplicate ones(?) )

## Credits
- **Eternity** - Huge thanks goes to Eternity for his/her initial work on a DBXV2 save file decryptor/encryptor ([xv2savdec](http://animegamemods.net/thread/701/tools-eternity)) for PS4/XBone/PC
- **Falo** - For converting the [xv2savdec](https://gbatemp.net/threads/is-xenoverse-2-save-encryption-being-worked-on-by-anyone.512671/#post-8209053) for the Switch, he/she converted the decryption function while I converted the encryption function
